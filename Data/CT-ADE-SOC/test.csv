Subjects for this study will meet the following criteria:

Self-report of the onset of depression associated with menstrual cycle irregularity or amenorrhea;
A current episode of minor (meeting 3-4 criterion symptoms) or major depression (of moderate severity or less on the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV (SCID) severity scale and not meeting DSM-IV criteria symptom 9 (suicide)) as determined by the administration of the minor depression module of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia - Lifetime Version (SADS-L). Additionally, to ensure that subjects meet a minimum threshold for severity of depression, subjects will have scores greater than or equal to 10 on either the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) Scale during at least three of the four clinic visits during the two month screening phase, as well as a 17 item Hamilton Depression score greater than or equal to 10. Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: major depression of greater than moderate severity, DSM-IV criteria # 9 (suicide), or anyone requiring immediate treatment after clinical assessment or functional impairment ratings of five or six for more than seven consecutive days on daily ratings;
Evidence of perimenopausal reproductive status;
Age 40 to 60;
No prior hormonal therapy for the treatment of perimenopause-related mood or physical symptoms within the last six months;
No history of psychiatric illness during the two years prior to the reported onset of the current episode of depression;
In good medical health, and not taking any medication or dietary and herbal supplements on a regular basis (with the exception of multivitamins and calcium supplements).

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

The following conditions will constitute contraindications to treatment and will preclude a subject s participation in this protocol:

1) Severe major depression with any of the following:

positive (threshold) response to SCID major depression section item # 9, suicidal ideation;
anyone requiring immediate treatment after clinical assessment;
severity ratings greater than moderate on the SCID IV interview;
functional impairment ratings of five or six for more than seven consecutive days on daily ratings.

2) Current treatment with antidepressant medications. Our main concern is to exclude subjects taking medications that would treat or precipitate depression or adversely interact with reproductive hormones, phytoestrogens (e.g., anticoagulants), or SERMs. Thus, we wish to exclude only women receiving psychotropic medications, medications that have been reported to induce a change in mood or behavior, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive agents, or medications that may have a potential adverse interaction with the compounds employed in this study.

3) History of psychiatric illness during the two years before the reported onset of the current episode of depression.

4) History of ischemic cardiac disease, pulmonary embolism, retinal thrombosis, or thrombophlebitis; any subject with risk factors for thrombo-embolic phenomena including cigarette smokers; varicose veins, patients with prolonged periods of immobilization (including prolonged travel), and active heart disease. The literature suggests that although both smoking and hormone replacement/oral contraceptives have associated risks of thromboembolic phenomena and cardiovascular events, these individual risks do not become significantly greater when combined until greater than 10 cigarettes a day are consumed. Thus we wish to exclude only subjects for this study who smoke greater than 10 cigarettes per day.

5) Renal disease, asthma.

6) Hepatic dysfunction.

7) Women with a history of carcinoma of the breast, or any women with a family history of the following: premenopausal breast cancer or bilateral breast cancer in a first degree relative; multiple family members (greater than three relatives) with postmenopausal breast cancer.

8) Women with a history of uterine cancer, endometriosis, ill-defined pelvic lesions, particularly undiagnosed ovarian enlargement, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

9) Patients with a known hypersensitivity to raloxifene, phytoestrogens (including Rimostil, isoflavones, genistein, daidzein, red clover extract and soy-related compounds), estradiol, Alora, medroxyprogesterone acetate, or the excipients (inactive compounds) contained within these medications including: Rimostil -tocopherols, cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium stearate, silica-colloidal anhydrous; Provera - calcium stearate, corn starch, lactose, mineral oil, sorbic acid, sucrose, talc; Alora - sorbitan monooleate, acrylic adhesive; Evista - anhydrous lactose, carnauba wax, crospovidone, Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD& C) blue # 2 aluminum lake, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, modified pharmaceutical glaze, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, and titanium dioxide.

The subject's treating physician is planning to prescribe levetiracetam for focal or lamotrigine for generalized seizure prevention
Either symptomatic or idiopathic seizures.

Exclusion Criteria:

Non-native English speaking and/or multilingual
Frequent seizures, since seizures themselves impair cognitive function and present a confounding variable. Subjects may have no more than one seizure or one cluster of seizures per month, with a cluster of seizures including more than one seizure, but between which the patient returns to baseline. The cluster may occur over no more than two consecutive days in one month.
Seizure(s) must not have occurred within 3 days of enrollment and testing.
Those with focal seizures who have evidence of renal disease (creatinine clearance less than 80) will be excluded from participation, as levetiracetam is cleared by the kidney.
Those with focal seizures who have neutrophil counts <1000/microliter will be excluded from participation, as levetiracetam may lower white blood cell counts.
Those with focal seizures and irritability or mood swings will not be eligible for participation, as levetiracetam may exacerbate these symptoms. This will be determined by self-report, information obtained from the referring physician and medical record.
Those with generalized seizures who have moderate to severe liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh Grades B and C) will be excluded from participation, as lamotrigine is cleared by the liver and the proposed dosing may not be tolerable in this population. This will be determined by self-report, information obtained from the referring physician, a comprehensive metabolic panel (routinely obtained in new-onset seizures) and the medical record.
Subjects who are pregnant will not be eligible to take part in the study, as levetiracetam and lamotrigine are classified as Pregnancy Category C drugs and may pose risk to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test prior to participation in the study. The urine pregnancy test will be repeated at the final study visit. Subjects with epilepsy who are of childbearing potential must use acceptable methods of birth control during the study, to be continued until one month after discontinuation of the study drug. If a subject does become pregnant during this time period, she must notify the investigators.
Women who are breastfeeding may not participate in this study. Levetiracetam and lamotrigine may pass into the breastmilk of nursing mothers, posing a risk to the baby.

Mothers must have anti-Ro and/or anti-La Ab documented in the NYU immunology laboratory (CLIA-approved), which utilizes an ELISA as well as reactivity on ELISA to at least one of three recombinant antigens (48La, 52Ro, 60Ro, JB laboratory).
Mothers must have a previous child with cardiac NL, defined herein as: the presence of heart block (1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree) documented by electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram, pacemaker, or statement in the medical record, and/or; presence of cardiac injury, which specifically includes autopsy evidence of a mononuclear infiltrate in the endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium and/or EFE on echocardiogram always associated with cardiac dysfunction. In PITCH, we included women with a prior child with rash; however, recent data generated from the RRNL suggest that recurrence of CHB following rash is 11%, not 18% [34]. Thus, inclusion of previous rash could lead to a falsely lowered recurrence rate, and will therefore be excluded.
Intrauterine pregnancy ≤10 weeks.
Mother may be taking ≤20 mg prednisone because, in our experience, CHB has developed in the presence of this dose.
Mother may be asymptomatic, or have a rheumatic disease such as SLE or SS. Maternal health status has not been considered an influence on the development of CHB.
Mother may or may not already be taking HCQ. This latter point was discussed with Dr. Nathalie Costedoat-Chalumeau, who has published extensively on measurement of HCQ. While it might be optimal for the mothers anticipating enrollment in the study to all have been on HCQ prior to conception, this is impractical. Some may never achieve pregnancy and not want to take HCQ unless they conceive (especially those asymptomatic). On the other hand, women with SLE are likely to already be on HCQ and it would limit enrollment to exclude these patients if all must initiate HCQ only at enrollment in the first trimester. Although the accepted dogma is that HCQ requires several months for maximal efficacy in treating rheumatic disease, it is unknown whether this would apply to transplacental passage or fetal levels (which are impossible to measure). Dr. Costedoat-Chalumeau suggests that HCQ is probably a three compartment model which includes the circulation, tissues and cells. In the circulation, the half life is approximately 7 days and in the tissues, it is 40 days. In Dr. Costedoat-Chalumeau's experience, steady state blood levels of HCQ are achieved in 4-6 weeks. Thus, dosing the mother no later than 10 weeks gestation should provide sufficient fetal exposure before the vulnerable period of CHB which is generally accepted to span 18-24 wks. Furthermore, the placenta has to be formed for HCQ to gain access to the fetus and it may be effective quickly for the biology we are considering.

Exclusion Criteria:

Mother does not have Ab to Ro or La.

Identification of any of the following structural lesions considered causal for CHB, i.e., those that could account for block because of fibrous disruption between the atrium and AV node or due to absence of the penetrating bundles of the AV node:

atrioventricular septal defects;
b) single ventricle
c) developmental tricuspid valve disease;
d) L-transposition of the great arteries;
e) heterotaxia.
Mother is taking any glucocorticoids. Although unlikely to be preventative, the use of steroids may confound the interpretation of results. The final point of intense discussion centered around whether another exclusion should be the use of HCQ in the first pregnancy in which CHB occurred. While one could argue that in these mothers HCQ was not effective and perhaps will not be again, this assumption remains speculative and thus prior absence of efficacy of HCQ will not constitute an exclusion criteria.","400 mg/day Hydroxychloroquine

Study Eye Exclusion Criteria

Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

An eye should not be considered eligible if:

The macular edema is considered to be related to cataract extraction; or
Clinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of the macular edema.
An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy, pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, non-retinal condition).
An ocular condition is present (other than diabetic retinopathy (DR) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).
Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).
History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within four months prior to study entry.
History of prior pars plana vitrectomy within six months prior to study entry.
History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study entry.
History of Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) capsulotomy performed within two months prior to study entry.
History of treatment within three months prior to enrollment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at the time of study entry, such as intravitreal or periocular steroids or intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.

Choice of Study Eye in Cases of Bilateral Disease

If both eyes of a participant meet the criteria described above, the following will be used to determine the study eye:

If one eye is treatment-naïve and the other is not, the treatment-naïve eye will be chosen as the study eye.
If both eyes are treatment-naïve, the eye with the better visual acuity will be chosen as the study eye.
If both eyes are treatment-naïve and are equivalent, the choice of study eye will be determined at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.
If both eyes have been previously treated, the choice of study eye will be determined at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.",Dextromethorphan hydrobromide: Participants instructed to take 60 mg dextromethorphan capsules orally two times a day for 24 months.,ChEMBL:CHEMBL657 | DrugBank:DB01075 | PubChem:3100,Diphenhydramine,CN(C)CCOC(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1,D04AA32 | D04AA33 | R06AA02 | R06AA52,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Exclusion Criteria:

Patients will be excluded (i.e., not consented) for any of the following reasons:

Rapidly resolving organ failure, indicated by planned immediate discontinuation of MV, at time of screening for study enrollment
Pregnant or breastfeeding
Severe dementia or neurodegenerative disease, defined as either impairment that prevents the patient from living independently at baseline or IQCODE >4.5, measured using a patient's qualified surrogate. This exclusion also pertains to mental illnesses requiring long-term institutionalization, acquired or congenital mental retardation, severe neuromuscular disorders, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. It also excludes patients in coma or with severe deficits due to structural brain diseases such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial trauma, malignancy, anoxic brain injury, or cerebral edema.
History of 2nd or 3rd degree heart block, bradycardia < 50 beats/minute, pacemaker for bradyarrythmias or uncompensated shock.If patient has a pacemaker for bradyarrythmias, then patient does not meet this exclusion criterion and may be enrolled.

Active seizures during this ICU admission being treated with intravenous benzodiazepines.
Expected death within 24 hours of enrollment or lack of commitment to aggressive treatment by family/medical team (e.g., likely to withdraw life support measures within 24 hrs of screening)
Inability to understand English or deafness or vision loss that will preclude delirium evaluation. The inability to understand English (for example in Spanish-only or Mandarin-only speaking patients) will not result in exclusion at centers where the research staff is proficient and/or translation services are actively available in that particular language; these patients will not be followed in the long-term follow-up phase of the trial since the testing materials are primarily available only in English. Patients with laryngectomies and those with hearing deficits are eligible for enrollment if their medical condition permits them to communicate with research staff.

Inability to obtain informed consent from an authorized representative within 48 hours of meeting all inclusion criteria, i.e., developing sepsis and qualifying organ dysfunction criteria for the following reasons:

Attending physician refusal.
Patient and/or surrogate refusal.

Patients who are on muscle relaxant infusions at time of screening with plans to maintain paralysis >48 hours.
Greater than 96 hours on mechanical ventilation prior to meeting all inclusion criteria.","Route and Concentration. The study drug will be administered intravenously (IV) by continuous infusion at concentrations of 5 mcg/mL dexmedetomidine. Patients will only receive study drug while in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation, and thus will be monitored with continuous telemetry as per usual ICU practice.

Dosing Range. Study drug dose will be titrated in a double-blind manner according to clinical effect to achieve a ""goal"" or ""target"" Richmond Agitation Sedation Score set by the managing clinical team. For patients in the dexmedetomidine group, dose will range from 0.15-1.5 mcg/kg/hr.

Dexmedetomidine: For patients in the dexmedetomidine group, dose will range from 0.15-1.5 mcg/kg/hr. For example, a 70 kg patient would receive 10.5 mL of study drug per hour, which would provide 0.75 mcg/kg/hr of dexmedetomidine.

Males and females at least 18 years of age, with body mass not less than 50 kg.
Female subjects had to be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or using a reliable method of contraception.
Subjects suffering from a chronic illness, other than hepatic impairment, had to have a stable condition, regarded by the investigator as unlikely to influence the outcome of the study.
Renal failure, the extent of which, as measured by the creatinine clearance, resulted in recruitment to one of five renal function groups.
Medical records indicating a stable serum creatinine (variation of not more than 30%), for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit (Groups 2 to 4 only), as determined by the clinical investigator. The sérum creatinine had to be stable to allow for an accurate determination of the creatinine clearance and therefore allowed for correct allocation to one of the renal function groups. Subjects who were recruited into Group 1 had normal renal function.

Exclusion Criteria:

The receipt of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to this study.
Clinically significant abnormal findings (as judged by the investigator) for the following parameters, except those consistent with findings in renal failure: haematology, biochemistry, clotting profile, urinalysis, vital signs or ECG screening tests.
A history or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment and/or disease. Owing to the metabolic pathway of BIA 2-093, any degree of hepatic impairment would have had a confounding effect on the PK analysis.
Positive test for HIV-1 or HIV-2 Antibodies, Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C Antibodies.

HIV positive patients, and patients with Hepatitis B and C, generally have a below average, and in some cases a markedly decreased, level of health owing to the nature of the respective infections and the natural course of the diseases, both of which are often complicated by an array of opportunistic illnesses. Their ill health would have been further worsened by the fact that the patients are invarious degrees of renal failure, which has its own, often debilitating, complications. If patients with HIV or Hepatitis B or C were included in the study, this could have led to statistical confusion when assessing the safety and tolerability parameters. This is because events reported by the patients, which may be a part of the spectrum of complaints in HIV positive patients and Hepatitis B and C patients, would have confounded the safety and tolerability analysis. Furthermore, Hepatitis B and C, which may cause an element of hepatic impairment, would have confounded the PK analysis due to the metabolic pathway of BIA 2-093. In addition, by administering the study medication to these subjects, any adverse events that might have occurred would have added to the discomfort of the patient.

A history of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, might have confounded the results.","normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 mL/min)

Males and females at least 18 years of age, with body mass not less than 50 kg.
Female subjects had to be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or using a reliable method of contraception.
Subjects suffering from a chronic illness, other than hepatic impairment, had to have a stable condition, regarded by the investigator as unlikely to influence the outcome of the study.
Renal failure, the extent of which, as measured by the creatinine clearance, resulted in recruitment to one of five renal function groups.
Medical records indicating a stable serum creatinine (variation of not more than 30%), for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit (Groups 2 to 4 only), as determined by the clinical investigator. The sérum creatinine had to be stable to allow for an accurate determination of the creatinine clearance and therefore allowed for correct allocation to one of the renal function groups. Subjects who were recruited into Group 1 had normal renal function.

Exclusion Criteria:

The receipt of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to this study.
Clinically significant abnormal findings (as judged by the investigator) for the following parameters, except those consistent with findings in renal failure: haematology, biochemistry, clotting profile, urinalysis, vital signs or ECG screening tests.
A history or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment and/or disease. Owing to the metabolic pathway of BIA 2-093, any degree of hepatic impairment would have had a confounding effect on the PK analysis.
Positive test for HIV-1 or HIV-2 Antibodies, Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C Antibodies.

HIV positive patients, and patients with Hepatitis B and C, generally have a below average, and in some cases a markedly decreased, level of health owing to the nature of the respective infections and the natural course of the diseases, both of which are often complicated by an array of opportunistic illnesses. Their ill health would have been further worsened by the fact that the patients are invarious degrees of renal failure, which has its own, often debilitating, complications. If patients with HIV or Hepatitis B or C were included in the study, this could have led to statistical confusion when assessing the safety and tolerability parameters. This is because events reported by the patients, which may be a part of the spectrum of complaints in HIV positive patients and Hepatitis B and C patients, would have confounded the safety and tolerability analysis. Furthermore, Hepatitis B and C, which may cause an element of hepatic impairment, would have confounded the PK analysis due to the metabolic pathway of BIA 2-093. In addition, by administering the study medication to these subjects, any adverse events that might have occurred would have added to the discomfort of the patient.

The subject is at least 18 years of age and may be of either sex/gender and of any race and ethnicity.

The subject is scheduled to undergo non-emergent PCI or non-emergent cardiac catheterization with the intention of performing PCI. The following classifications of the urgency of the procedure at the time the operator decides to perform it will be used for randomization stratification:

Elective: The cardiac catheterization procedure ± PCI can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a subsequent hospitalization without significant risk of MI or death. For stable inpatients, this is a procedure that is performed during the hospitalization for convenience and ease of scheduling only and not because the subject's clinical situation demands that the procedure be performed prior to discharge.

OR

Urgent: The cardiac catheterization ± PCI procedure should be performed on an inpatient basis and before discharge because of significant concerns about the risk of myocardial ischemia, MI and/or death. For subjects who are outpatients or in the emergency department at the time that the cardiac catheterization is requested, this is a procedure that would warrant hospital admission based on clinical presentation.
There is no anticipation that the subject would require treatment with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor prior to the initiation of the cardiac catheterization ± PCI procedure if the subject were not a participant in the current research study, and no anticipation of use during the procedure.

The subject is scheduled to undergo non-emergent PCI or non-emergent cardiac catheterization with the intention of performing PCI. The following classifications of the urgency of the procedure at the time the operator decides to perform it will be used for randomization stratification:

Elective: The cardiac catheterization procedure ± PCI can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a subsequent hospitalization without significant risk of MI or death. For stable inpatients, this is a procedure that is performed during the hospitalization for convenience and ease of scheduling only and not because the subject's clinical situation demands that the procedure be performed prior to discharge.

OR

Women with pathologically demonstrated breast cancer
Patients must be candidates for neoadjuvant paclitaxel chemotherapy by their treating oncologist. No other investigational or commercial therapeutic agents may be given concurrently with the paclitaxel.
Patients must not have metastatic disease on staging work-up with CBC and liver function studies.
A formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor block (preferred) or unstained slides must be available from a prior biopsy of the primary tumor or lymph node. A minimum of 8 slides must be available.
The primary tumor or lymph node must be readily biopsied by surgery or radiology teams.
The primary tumor must be measurable by an imaging modality prior to treatment. This imaging modality is to be repeated after completion of 4 cycles of paclitaxel and prior to surgery. Such imaging modalities may include ultrasound, CT, mammography, or MRI. MRI will be the preferred imaging modality if available because it has the highest accuracy and positive predictive value for predicting pathologic complete response.All imaging will be performed per standard of care at the discretion of the treating physicians.
Subjects may not have had prior systemic chemotherapy regimens administered for treatment of their current breast cancer. However, studies (window studies, for example) that are deemed non-therapeutic, including those that utilize agents that are not FDA approved for the treatment of the patient's current breast cancer, are permitted.
Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as determined by the treating oncologist.
Patient must be willing to undergo additional biopsy of breast tumor or lymph node.
Patient must have the ability and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
Women of childbearing potential (per UWCCC policy definition) must agree to use effective contraception as discussed with treating oncologist for the duration of the study.

Exclusion Criteria:

History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to paclitaxel including to other drugs formulated in Cremophor(R) EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil).
Patients with known HIV due to concern that chemotherapy may cause further immunosuppression and potential infectious complications.
Patients on non-aspirin anti-coagulation (Coumadin, heparins, or clopidogrel) or with documented bleeding disorders will be excluded due to risk of bleeding with biopsy.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active severe infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, other malignancies requiring therapy or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because paclitaxel is a pregnancy category D drug and may cause deleterious effects to the fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with paclitaxel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled in the trial.","Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 will be initiated as standard infusion on days 1, 8, 15 of a 21-day cycle.

All participants will receive a test dose of the fat challenge during the screening visit, which consists of heavy cream and lactase enzyme. Many people with lactose intolerance successfully avert symptoms by correcting their lactase deficiency with lactase supplements. We will allow these people to participate because we will allow them to take their preferred brand and dose of lactase supplement beyond the lactase in the fat challenge if needed. However, we still require that they are able to tolerate the test dose given during screening.

43. Chronic, untreated conditions that predispose to anemia, such as significant iron or B vitamin malabsorption, persistent menorrhagia, or other chronic or intermittent bleeding.

44. Participation in an investigational drug study concurrently; participants who previously completed an investigational drug study cannot participate in the first experimental visit until at least 6 weeks after the final dose given during the previous investigational drug study. For the purposes of this exclusion, an investigational drug is a new chemical entity or a pharmaceutical investigated to support an initial new drug application. Furthermore, herbal or other supplements already deemed ""generally regarded as safe"" or legally sold in the U.S. would not be considered an investigational drug.

45. Use of medications indicated for the treatment of diabetes within 6 weeks of the first experimental visit 46. Daily therapy with non-statin lipid-altering medications within 6 weeks of the first experimental visit is exclusionary, including long-term therapy with the agents listed below.

Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to participate in the study:

Underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy with removal of at least one adenoma;

Age 18-80 years.

This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis in children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with distinct biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in adults. Patients over age 80 will not be enrolled since the benefits and risks of AMR101 over the age of 80 have not yet been well-characterized.
ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)
The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Any adenoma that was not completely removed during previous colonoscopy.
Known bleeding tendency/condition (e.g. von Willebrand disease) or history of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleed, endoscopic complications, or contraindication to colonoscopy.
Current use of anticoagulant therapies, including Heparin, Warfarin, Dalteparin sodium,Bivalirudin, Argatroban, Lepirudin, Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and an unwillingness or inability to discontinue anticoagulants.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Inability or unwillingness to abstain from non-protocol use of fish oil supplements or to provide blood or stool samples or colon biopsies during the study.
Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.
Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills.
Pregnant or breastfeeding. The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Similarly, lactating women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AMR101. Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on the study.
Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or acute or chronic hepatitis B infection. Participants with these infections are ineligible because they are at increased risk of significant complications in the perioperative period, and because fresh tissue from patients with these infections cannot be harvested for research purposes, per institutional policy.
