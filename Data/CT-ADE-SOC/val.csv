T1-4 (Tumor size > 1 cm), N0, M0 or T1-4, N1-3, M0
Patients with bilateral, synchronous breast cancer are eligible as long as one primary tumor meets the criteria above.

Patients with HER2/neu positive, negative or unknown disease are eligible for this trial.

Patients whose tumors are HER2 positive by either immunohistochemistry 3+ staining or demonstrate gene amplification by FISH will be eligible to receive trastuzumab, as outlined in the protocol.

Age 65 years or older
Performance status 0-2 (Common Toxicity Criteria).

Prior treatment:

Surgical resection -

All tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a lumpectomy. Patients must be registered ≤ 84 days from mastectomy or within 84 days of axillary dissection if patient's most extensive breast surgery was a breast sparing procedure.
Node dissection: Axillary node dissection is not required. Management of the axilla is at the discretion of the treating physician. There is no restriction on eligibility based on the number of nodes removed.
Mastectomy: There should be no evidence of gross or microscopic invasive tumor at the surgical resection margins noted in the final surgery or pathology reports for patients who have had a modified radical mastectomy. Patients with close margins (tumor < 1 mm from margin) are eligible.
Segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy): Although clear margins are preferable, DCIS or LCIS at the surgical resection margin will not render a patient who has undergone a segmental mastectomy ineligible for this study. Invasive tumor at the final resection margin will render a patient ineligible.
No prior chemotherapy for this malignancy.
Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to 5-FU or known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency are not eligible to participate.
Patients may receive up to four weeks of tamoxifen therapy for this malignancy and still be eligible for study entry. Patients who received tamoxifen or raloxifene for purposes of chemoprevention (e.g., Breast Cancer Prevention Trial) or for other indications (including previous breast cancer) are eligible.

Must be a veteran.
The number of migraine days per 4-week period is to be 4-14 for a period of 3 months prior to screening for entry into the trial.
Migraine must have been occurring for 6 months preceding entry into the trial and age of onset should be before age 60 years.
Migraine must be at least moderate severity and interrupt daily activities in some respect at least 3 times per month.
As long as the veteran can easily distinguish nonmigraine headaches from migraine, there is no limit on the number of non migraine headache days allowed. ""Transformed migraine"" headaches due to medication over usage will be excluded according to exclusion criteria #4.
Migraine diagnosis:

Veterans with headache must have migraine categorized using the International Headache Society (I.H.S.) criteria as illustrated below for the two main types with and without aura.

Criteria for migraine without aura (I.H.S. 1.1)

> 5 attacks
headache lasting 4-72 hours when untreated or not successfully treated.

headache with two of the following characteristics

unilateral,
pulsating,
moderate to severe intensity,
aggravation by exertion.

one of the following occurs with headache

nausea and/or vomiting
photophobia and phonophobia

Criteria for migraine with aura (I.H.S. 1.2)

at least 2 attacks

at least three of the following characteristics:

One or more fully reversible aura symptoms indicating focal cerebral cortical - and/or brain stem dysfunction.

One or more aura symptoms of the following types:

Homonymous visual disturbance
Unilateral parenthesis and/or numbness
Unilateral weakness

Aphasia or unclassifiable speech difficulty

At least one aura symptom develops gradually over more than 4 minutes or, 2 or more symptoms occur in succession.
No aura symptom lasts more than 60 minutes. If more than one aura symptom is present, accepted duration is proportionally increased.
Headache follows aura with a free interval of less than 60 minutes. (It may also begin before or simultaneously with the aura). Headache, nausea and/or photophobia usually follow neurological aura symptoms directly or after a free interval of less than an hour.

Patients must have tumour tissue from their primary and/or metastatic tumour available to assess putative molecular markers of response (paraffin block or 12 unstained slides).
Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of disease must be unidimensionally measurable as follows:

Chest X-ray > 20 mm, CT scan (with slice thickness of < 5 mm) >10 mm (longest diameter), Physical exam (using calipers) > 10 mm, Lymph nodes by CT scan > 15 mm measured in short axis.

All radiology studies must be performed within 21 days prior to randomization (Exception: Within 28 days if negative).

Patients must have either maximum tumour lesion size of ≤ 50 mm OR if tumour lesion is > 50 mm, LDH must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN.
Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.
Age > 18 years.
ECOG performance status of 0-1.
Previous Therapy:

Immunotherapy: Prior adjuvant immunotherapy for melanoma is permitted if completed ≥ 1 month prior to study entry. No immunotherapy for metastatic disease is permitted. rIL-21 or dacarbazine must be the first systemic therapy for metastatic disease.

Chemotherapy: Patients must not have received any prior chemotherapy (including regional therapy). rIL-21 or dacarbazine must be the first systemic therapy for metastatic disease (except for RAF and MEK-Inhibitors).

Surgery: Previous surgery is permissible. Patient must be > 4 weeks since any major surgery.

Radiation Therapy: Previous radiation therapy is permitted with exception of radiation therapy for brain metastases. Patients must be > 4 weeks since the last treatment with radiation. Exceptions may be made, however, for low dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of radiation.

Laboratory Requirements: (must be done within 7 days prior to randomization) Hematology: Absolute granulocytes (AGC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Chemistry: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL, Bilirubin ≤ UNL AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x UNL, LDH ≤ 2.5 x UNL.
Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of enrollment.
Sexually active patients must agree to use a medically accepted form of contraception while receiving study therapy.
Patient consent must be obtained according to local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirements. It will be the responsibility of the local participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to indicate in writing to the NCIC CTG Study Coordinator that such clearance has been obtained, before the trial can commence in that centre. Because of differing requirements, a standard consent form for the trial will not be provided but a sample form is given in Appendix VII. A copy of the initial REB approval and approved consent form must be sent to the central office. The patient must sign the consent form prior to randomization. Please note that the consent form for this study must contain a statement which gives permission for qualified representatives of the NCIC CTG, BMS, ZymoGenetics, the company collaborator, and regulatory authorities to review patient records (see section 16 for further details) and a statement which gives permission for NCIC CTG to access and study tissue for biomarker assessments.
Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients randomized on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 2 hour's driving distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial.
In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days of patient randomization.

Exclusion Criteria:

Patients with known HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection.
History of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for > 5 years.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, other interventional cardiac procedure within the past 12 months, autoimmune conditions requiring chronic immunosuppressive therapy, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within 28 days of study entry, and may not receive concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy or investigational agents while on protocol therapy.
Patients with known brain metastases or history of CNS metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. A head CT or MRI is required on all patients to rule out brain metastases.
Pregnant or lactating women. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with rIL-21 or dacarbazine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with protocol therapy.
Prohibited Medications: Long Term (> 7 days) Systemic Corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, dexamethasone, etc.) because these may counteract the stimulatory effects of rIL-21 on lymphocytes. (Note: Topical steroids are allowed).","Dacarbazine: 1000 mg/m2 IV Day 1, every 3 weeks",ChEMBL:CHEMBL476 | DrugBank:DB00851 | PubChem:135398738 | PubChem:2942,Dacarbazine,CN(C)/N=N/c1[nH]cnc1C(N)=O,L01AX04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.
The effects of Adavosertib (AZD1775) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because molecular inhibitors of Wee1 kinase are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WoCBP) may be included only if acceptable contraception is in place for two weeks before study entry, for the duration of the treatment with the study drug, and for 2 months after the last dose of AZD1775. Male patients who are involved in the study must agree to avoid procreative and unprotected sex (i.e., by using acceptable forms of contraception) and must not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of AZD1775. Where the female partner is pregnant or not using effective birth control, men should be advised to abstain while in the study and for 3 months after the last dose of AZD1775. Female partners, who are of child-bearing potential, of men participating in clinical studies of AZD1775 will also be required to use effective contraceptive measures while their partner is on study drug and for 3 months thereafter. Male patients will be advised to arrange for the freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study should they wish to father children while on AZD1775 or during the 3 months after stopping AZD1775.
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the first of study drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug.
Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets or capsules. Nasogastric or G-tube administration is not allowed. Any gastrointestinal disease which would impair ability to swallow, retain, or absorb drug is not allowed.
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
Patients with prostate cancer can continue to receive treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists while on study, as long as there is evidence of disease progression on therapy.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.
Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial. Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases are eligible to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator.
Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 will be determined following review by the principal investigator.
Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), or CYP3A4 substrates need to be reviewed by the principal investigator. Continuation of such medications will be at the discretion of the principal investigator. Concomitant use of aprepitant or fosaprepitant is prohibited. As grapefruit and Seville oranges are known to contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, these fruits or their products (including marmalade, juice, etc.) should be avoided while taking AZD1775. The use of sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, such as atorvastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin, is also prohibited in this study. Herbal preparations are not allowed throughout the study. These herbal medications include but are not limited to: St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (mahung), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto and ginseng.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetics (PK) interactions.

Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for which all standard therapy known to prolong survival have failed or for which standard therapies do not exist.

Patients must have measurable disease or evaluable disease for the escalation phase; for the 6 additional patients enrolled at maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for further evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) endpoints (Expansion Cohort A). For the 6-patient breast cancer gene (BRCA)-mutation expansion cohort, patients must have measurable disease; however, tumor biopsies are optional. For Expansion Cohort B, patients must have tumor amenable to biopsy (excisional or incision biopsies of skin or head (H) & neck (N) lesions under visualization) and willingness to undergo a tumor biopsy or patient will be undergoing a procedure due to medical necessity during which the tissue may be collected, or tumor biopsy tissue from a previous research study or medical care is available for submission at registration. Criteria for the submission of tissue are:

Tissue must have been collected within 3 months prior to registration
Patient has not received any intervening therapy for their cancer since the collection of the tumor sample
Tumor tissue must meet the minimum requirements
Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or biologic therapy greater than or equal to 3 weeks (or > 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter) prior to entering the study. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior administration of a study drug in an exploratory Investigational New Drug (IND)/Phase 0 study or more than or equal to 1 week from palliative radiation therapy. Patients must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events.
Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 1 (Karnofsky >60%)
Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.
The effects of Adavosertib (AZD1775) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because molecular inhibitors of Wee1 kinase are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WoCBP) may be included only if acceptable contraception is in place for two weeks before study entry, for the duration of the treatment with the study drug, and for 2 months after the last dose of AZD1775. Male patients who are involved in the study must agree to avoid procreative and unprotected sex (i.e., by using acceptable forms of contraception) and must not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of AZD1775. Where the female partner is pregnant or not using effective birth control, men should be advised to abstain while in the study and for 3 months after the last dose of AZD1775. Female partners, who are of child-bearing potential, of men participating in clinical studies of AZD1775 will also be required to use effective contraceptive measures while their partner is on study drug and for 3 months thereafter. Male patients will be advised to arrange for the freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study should they wish to father children while on AZD1775 or during the 3 months after stopping AZD1775.
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the first of study drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug.
Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets or capsules. Nasogastric or G-tube administration is not allowed. Any gastrointestinal disease which would impair ability to swallow, retain, or absorb drug is not allowed.
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
Patients with prostate cancer can continue to receive treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists while on study, as long as there is evidence of disease progression on therapy.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.
Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial. Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases are eligible to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator.
Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 will be determined following review by the principal investigator.
Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), or CYP3A4 substrates need to be reviewed by the principal investigator. Continuation of such medications will be at the discretion of the principal investigator. Concomitant use of aprepitant or fosaprepitant is prohibited. As grapefruit and Seville oranges are known to contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, these fruits or their products (including marmalade, juice, etc.) should be avoided while taking AZD1775. The use of sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, such as atorvastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin, is also prohibited in this study. Herbal preparations are not allowed throughout the study. These herbal medications include but are not limited to: St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (mahung), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto and ginseng.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetics (PK) interactions.

Melanoma must be documented to contain a BRAFV600 mutation by a FDA approved assay
Age > 18 years
ECOG PS 0,1, or 2
Participants must have measurable melanoma. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be measured accurately in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions may be considered measurable if they can be measured reliably as ≥ 10 mm by direct physical exam measurement.

In addition, participants must also have separate disease, which may or may not be measurable as defined by RECIST, but must be readily accessible for core needle biopsy, excisional biopsy, and/or surgical resection. This disease may include one large tumor tissue deposit from which biopsies can be harvested multiple times or may include multiple deposits which can be biopsied, or excised individually, on different dates. Please see below for suggested minimum size requirements of tumor tissue to be used for biopsy for research:

1 lesion ≥ 5 cm3 or
2 lesions ≥ 3 cm3 each
3 lesions ≥ 2 cm3each OR
≥ 3 skin lesions, such that the surface area is approximately 1 cm^2 each (or in aggregate for several lesions) and the total volume of tumor I s approximately 260-325 mm^3 or greater for each biopsy time point. These subjects will need ≥ 3 such epidermal/dermal tumor lesions; excisional tumor tissue biopsies will be performed on one or more lesions at each time point. It is acceptable to biopsy more than one lesion, that may be less than 1 cm^2 in surface area, as long as the total tissue removed has a surface area of approximately 1 cm^2 or greater.
A combination of these may be acceptable, as long as there appears to be enough tumor tissue to remove approximately 325 mm^3 or more of tissue at each time point.

Lesion volume can be calculated based on the formula for volume of a sphere (4/3 r3). An acceptable approximation for lesions approaching spherical shape is to multiply the diameters in three perpendicular directions and divide by 2. [Volume ~ ½(D1xD2xD3); e.g.: volume of a 2 x 2 x 3 cm lesion is approximately 6 cm3. Lesion measurements are based on length X width X depth (height) of sample.]

Women must not be pregnant due to the fact that the effects of vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 6 months after completion of study treatment. See Appendix H for acceptable and unacceptable forms of contraception. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. A female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib, breastfeeding must be discontinued prior to treatment Day 1 of the study.
Patients must have measurable disease as defined in Section 9.1. Cutaneous lesions or lymph nodes measuring at least 1 cm will be considered measurable. Baseline CT or MRI scans of measurable disease sites must be performed within 4 weeks of study entry.

Patients may have received any number of prior systemic treatment regimens for distant metastatic disease or advanced regional disease. The following prior therapy is permitted in either the adjuvant or metastatic disease setting:

No prior therapy
Immunotherapy consisting of interferon-alpha, interleukin-2, GM-CSF, ipilimumab, anti-PD1, cancer vaccines, or other experimental agent.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy consisting of dacarbazine, temozolomide, carboplatin, or paclitaxel alone or in combination.
Targeted therapy with temsirolimus, bevacizumab, or sorafenib.
Patients who have had prior therapy with a MEK inhibitor or an inhibitor of mutant BRAF are ineligible. Because sorafenib has low efficacy as a BRAF inhibitor, prior therapy with it is allowed.

If following the initial hydrocortisone wean, the patient requires fluid boluses and/or an increase in their vasoactive infusion(s), their hydrocortisone will be increased back to 1 mg/kg of hydrocortisone IV q6h until they meet stability criteria again. Duration of treatment will range from a minimum of 20 hours to a maximum of 7 days of study drug.

The investigators will use the SSRI escitalopram (Lexapro), which has received FDA approval for the treatment of anxiety, in 5 mg capsules. Medication will be dispensed as capsules of escitalopram in individually coded bottles. Medication adherence will be assessed using pill count at each study visit. Patients will visit face-to-face with a study psychiatrist at week 0 (baseline), week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12 with phone encounters at weeks 3 and 6. The psychiatrist will make all medication adjustments based primarily upon Spielberger Anxiety Scores. Depending on symptoms, daily escitalopram doses will be titrated to 10 mg after week 2 and to 15 mg or placebo equivalent at week 3 if patients show no change or only minimal improvement.

Acute (less than 1 week in duration) severe pain necessitating use of intravenous (IV) opioids in the judgement of the treating attending physician

Exclusion Criteria:

Use of other opioids or tramadol within past 24 hours: to avoid introducing assembly bias related to recent opioid use, since this may affect baseline levels of pain and need for analgesics.
Prior adverse reaction to hydromorphone, morphine, or acetaminophen.
Chronic pain syndrome: frequently recurrent or daily pain for at least 3 months results in modulation of pain perception which is thought to be due to down-regulation of pain receptors. Examples of chronic pain syndromes include sickle cell anemia, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and peripheral neuropathies.
Alcohol intoxication: the presence of alcohol intoxication as judged by the treating physician may alter pain perception.
Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) <100 mm Hg: Opioids can produce peripheral vasodilation that may result in orthostatic hypotension.
Heart Rate (HR) < 60/min: Opioids can cause bradycardia.
Oxygen saturation < 95% on room air: For this study, oxygen saturation must be 95% or above on room air in order to be enrolled.
Use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors in past 30 days: MAO inhibitors have been reported to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant respiratory depression or coma.

The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620 administration.
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document (or parent or legally authorized representative, if minor).

Exclusion Criteria:

Participants who have had chemotherapy, immune therapy, other investigational therapy, major surgery, or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study, or participants who have not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline from therapies administered more than 3 weeks prior (with the exceptions of 1.

Participants who have previously received treatment with an ATR inhibitor, including but not limited to M6620 (VX-970).
Participants with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Participants with a history of brain metastases that have been treated, no longer require corticosteroids, and have been stable on imaging for at least one month following the end of treatment are permitted.
History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620.
Known HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the increased risk of lethal infections when treated with potentially marrow-suppressive therapy.
Patients with a history of another malignancy are excluded with the exception of 1. patients who remain disease-free for 3 years and 2. adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g. basal cell, squamous cell carcinomas), low-risk thyroid cancer.","M6620 will administered intravenously on days 1,4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25 on a 28-day cycle.

Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below (within 14 days prior to study registration):

leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL
absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL
hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion within 7 days of treatment
platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL
total bilirubin ≤ 2x upper limit of normal (ULN)

Female and male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of tretinoin administration. Contraception is required before starting the first dose of study medication through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. There is a significant risk of fetal malformation if pregnancy occurs while on tretinoin at any dose level, even if for short exposure periods.
Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

Exclusion Criteria:

Metastatic disease impinging on the spinal cord or threatening spinal cord compression. Patients that have had previous treatment of disease with impinging on the cord with either surgery or radiotherapy with clinical or radiographic evidence of response or stability are eligible.
Participant has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment), and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability, because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
Concurrent administration of other cancer specific therapy or investigational agents during the course of this study is not allowed.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.

Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
Subjects who are pregnant, or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because tretinoin has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this protocol. Women who could potentially become pregnant while undergoing treatment on this protocol must be willing to use 2 methods of contraception.","-Participants will receive Tretinoin orally divided over two daily doses for days 1 through 14 of a 28-day cycle

Currently incarcerated","At the completion of the subjects surgery but prior to awakening from anesthesia, 80mg of gentamicin in 50 mL of normal saline will be infused into the subject's bladder through the standard-of-care transurethral catheter by the surgeon. The surgeon will then clamp the catheter and label the catheter with the clamping time. The catheter will be clamped to prevent the gentamicin from immediately flowing out of the bladder and thus allow the gentamicin time to have an effect. The subject will then proceed as usual to the postoperative anesthesia care unit. A member of the subject's care team will unclamp the catheter after 1 hour. The subject will otherwise have usual pre-operative and post-operative care.

Oxygen requirements:

SpO2 ≤ 94% on ambient air OR
Requires supplemental oxygen administration by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen delivery device.

Male and/or female subjects.

- Contraception use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

All subjects (male or female) who are of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraception during the study. Female subjects and male partners of female subjects must continue to use highly effective contraception for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects should not donate oocytes during this time. Male subjects and female partners of male subjects must continue to use highly effective contraception for 90 days. Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm during this time.

Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.

Note: Ethinyl estradiol is the primary estrogen used in hormonal contraceptives. The progestin component consists of norethindrone, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, norgestimate, desogestrel, and drospirenone. As BLD-2660 is a weak CYP3A4 inducer, exposure to both the estrogen and progestin components in hormonal contraceptives may be decreased, resulting in an increased risk of pregnancy. As such, it is recommended that subjects who are on hormonal contraceptives for birth control should use an alternate means of contraception (condoms, diaphragms, intrauterine device (IUD), other barrier methods, sexual abstinence, etc.) during participation in the study.

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening within 72 hours prior to first administration of study drug.

Women not of childbearing potential must be postmenopausal (defined as cessation of regular menstrual periods for at least 1 year

Current drug use will be allowed if the candidate can produce a negative urine sample and are free of any signs/symptoms of withdrawal. The candidate will be informed if they have a positive breathalyzer test.
Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).
Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy) excluding cholecystectomy within 1 year prior to study.
Abnormal baseline EtCO2 <35mm Hg or >45 mm Hg.
Clinical or laboratory evidence of active hepatitis A infection or a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, and/or positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb).
Participants with active suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior within 5 years prior to Screening as determined through the use of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or active ideation identified at Screening or on Day 0.
Participants with any history of sleep apnea, myasthenia gravis or glaucoma.
Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.
Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product. (Refer to Section 6.5 for additional details).
Herbal supplements, herbal medications and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued at least 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.
Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) preceding the first dose of investigational product used in this study.
Positive urine drug screen (UDS) for substances of abuse at each admission in Qualification and Treatment Phase, excluding tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). If a participant presents with a positive UDS excluding THC at any admission or any visit, the investigator, at his/her discretion, may reschedule a repeat of UDS until the UDS is negative, excluding THC, before the participate is permitted to participate in any phase of the study.
Unable to abstain from using THC during the Qualification and Treatment Phase of the study.
Has participated in, is currently participating in, or is seeking treatment for substance and/or alcohol related disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine).
Has a positive alcohol breathalyzer or urine test at each admission to the study center during Qualification and Treatment Phases. Positive results may be repeated and/or participants re scheduled at the Investigator's discretions.
Participants are heavy smokers or users of other types of nicotine products (>20 cigarettes equivalents per day).
Participants are unable to abstain from smoking for at least 2 hours before and at least 8 hours after study drug administration.
Screening sitting blood pressure (BP) >=140 mm Hg (systolic) or >=90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes rest. If BP is >=140 mm Hg (systolic) or >=90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Repeated BP tests should be spaced at least 5 minutes apart.
Baseline (screening) 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval as determined by the Fridericia method (QTcF) >450 msec, complete left bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is >450 msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.

Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single repeat test, if deemed necessary:

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level >=1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN);
Total bilirubin level >=1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is <= ULN.
Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more within 60 days prior to dosing.
History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations section of this protocol.
History of hypersensitivity to gabapentin or oxycodone or any of the components in the formulation of the study products.
